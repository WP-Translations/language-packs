msgid "Hello Emoji is a plugin that converts emoticons to emoji. But it's more than a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation. It's proof of the idea that WordPress represents: that free software can bring people together to accomplish something that they couldn’t do themselves, while adding something of value to the commons for all to share."
