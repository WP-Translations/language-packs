It supports plenty of plugins like Gravity Forms, Co-Authors Plus, Smart Archives Reloaded and Social Path. It's responsive, it supports post formats, it's translation-ready and so much more. You can set global layout in theme settings: one column, two columns or three columns. You can have the content on the left, right or center. You can also set logo, background and footer text in theme settings. There are 5 widget areas, 3 menu locations and 9 page templates (most popular articles by comments or views in different time span, archives, authors, tag cloud and slider) in the theme. And guess what, sticky posts are in a cool FlexSlider. I hope you enjoy Path Theme as much I do. Cheers!"
